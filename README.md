# VueStore

I chose Vue to learn extend my knowledge in, because I was interested in learning other options for front-end frameworks. I have always seen Vue stickers, but never knew what it was used for until I was given the option to study it today during Teach yourself time. 
Vue can be used just like any other framework to render information to the front-end of the page. In my opinion, Vue is very similar to React.
